## Introduction

### Background

A nonprofit foundation `Alphabet Soup` wants to develop a tool that can help identify and select applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Using knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we must use the features in the provided dataset to create a `binary classifier` that can predict whether applicants will be `successful` if approved for funding by `Alphabet Soup`.

From `Alphabet Soup's` business team, a `CSV.file` containing more than `34,000` organisations that have recieved funding `Alphabet Soup` over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organisation. These include:

  - `EIN & NAME`: Identification columns
  - `APPLICATION_TYPE`: Alphabet Soup application type
  - `AFFILIATION`: Affiliated sector of industry
  - `CLASSIFICATION`: Government organisation classification
  - `USE_CASE`: Use case for funding
  - `ORGANIZATION`: Organisation type
  - `STATUS`: Active status
  - `INCOME_AMT`: Income classification
  - `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`: Special considerations for application
  - `ASK_AMT`: Funding amount requested
  - `IS_SUCCESSFUL`: Was the money used effectively
